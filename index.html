        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>

          Devil aims to be lightweight and simple to use framework for building
          REST APIs in Django. The learning curve should be minimal and you
          don't have to spend too much time going through the documentation
          before you can start using it. Having said that, Devil does offer more
          features for those who are willing to get to know it better.

        </p>
        <p>

          Devil is not a complete application framework in a sense that it does
          not mandate the architecture of your application in any way. It does
          not tell you how you should write your services/controllers/database
          models, it only streamlines the way you write REST APIs. You can
          concentrate on just implementing the <code>put</code> and
          <code>get</code> functions, while Devil will take care of things like
          content negotiation, data validation, data conversions and providing
          auto-generated documentation.

        </p>

        <h3>Basic Idea</h3>

        <p>

          Django alreay provides a nice way to <a
          href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/"> define
          URL schemes</a> for your application. For example (copied from the
          Django docs):

        </p>

<pre>
  <code>
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^articles/2003/$', 'news.views.special_case_2003'),
    (r'^articles/(\d{4})/$', 'news.views.year_archive'),
    (r'^articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/$', 'news.views.month_archive'),
    (r'^articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/(\d+)/$', 'news.views.article_detail'),
)
  </code>
</pre>

        <p>

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

        </p>
